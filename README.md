# Web Fiction Scraper - Configs

This repository stores all remote configs for the [Web Fiction Scraper](https://github.com/curetix/webfiction-scraper).

These configs can be listed using the command `webfictionscraper list-configs --remote`
and downloaded with `webfictionscraper download-config [--all] [config_name]`.

## Creating configs

The config for [The Wandering Inn - Volume 1](./configs/Wandering_Inn_Vol_1.yaml) contains detailed comments
on all available configuration options.

For a step-by-step guide, view this: [creating_configs.md](./docs/creating_configs.md) *(Work-in-Progress)*.

## Help

If you have problems with either an existing config or while creating one for a particular web fiction,
you are welcome to open a GitHub issue.

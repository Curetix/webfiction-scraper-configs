  title: Beware Of Chicken - Volume 2
  author: Casualfarmer
  description: |
    Jin Rou wanted to be a cultivator who defied the heavens, and surpassed all limits.
    
    Unfortunately for him, he died, and now Iâ€™m stuck here. Arrogant young masters? Heavenly tribulations? Cultivating for days on end, then getting into life or death battles?
    
    Yeah, no thanks. I'm getting out of here.
    
    In which a transmigrator decides that the only winning move is not to play.
